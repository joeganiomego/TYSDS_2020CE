The Preston function linking GDPPC to LEB is applied and explored for the historical Angus Maddison data and instant data 
of Preston functions at years 2005, 2009, 2012.
The Historical Preston Curve is found with the Angus Maddison data.  5 equation models are tested and the retained one has been chosen because of the 0.25 exponential, which is a recussing and nice number for all allometrist.
