DDE2D_technarian_01.jl  :
Main technarian age file, with ODE, SDE equations and charts.  HHa1 = 1.7 therefore not habitat constrained.
date = 22/02/2021


DDE2D_technarian_02.jl  :
Main technarian age file, with ODE, SDE equations and charts.  HHa1 = 0.7 therefore habitat constrained.
date = 22/02/2021


dynamicDDE2D_technarian_01.jl  :
Main technarian age file, with ODE, SDE equations and charts.  HHa1 goes from 3.7 to HHa2= 0.7 in about 50 years, showing the shift from
not habitat constrained to habitat constrained.
date = 22/02/2021
